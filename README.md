### Setup

Clone the repository, and install all the dependencies by executing the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the service executing the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

With the previous command, if you make changes to the files, those changes are not effective until you stop and 
restart the service. If you want to enable auto-updates (no more need to restart the server, the server will automatically
restart when the files are changed), instead of the previous command run the service executing the command:

```bash
npm run watch
```
