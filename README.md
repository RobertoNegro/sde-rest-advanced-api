### Setup

Clone the repository, and install all the dependencies by executing the command:

```bash
npm install
```

Rename the file `secrets.example.ts` in `secrets.ts` and open it with your favourite editor: you have to fill in the required api keys as already defined in the file.

Run the service executing the command:

```bash
npm run start
```
The server will automatically restart when the files are changed.
